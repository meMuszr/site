My time in the insuretech space was not short-lived. Being at the company since
2015, I had a lot of time to get caught up on the domain and was able to be a
fresh set of eyes to help drive improvements across their intranet
applications. My work involved:

- Being a full-stack developer utilizing the .NET stack to build out Windows Services, WPF apps, and modern
web-apps
- Responsibility for managing and extending web apps that reside on the intranet
- Gaining exposure and utilizing modern tooling and frameworks to incorporate into projects
- Developing unit and integration tests to maximize code coverage on the applications
