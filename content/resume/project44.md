My time spent at project44 included working very closely with the Tracking,
Supply Chain, and DevOps teams. More specifically, my work involved:

- Improving the Ocean product offering by increasing test coverage, including new
  data providers, and updating the codebase to follow best-practices
- Convert microservices from a container-based solution to a pod-based solution
  and updating the deployment process to deploy to EKS instead of ECS -
  utilizing helm templates
- Collaborate with PO and PM as well as the data services team to help progress
  the visibility and tracking of vessels and container
- Lead the efforts of integrating SMS notifications into the rule-based notification system
- Initial planning, scoping, and analysis phases of cloud environment migration
