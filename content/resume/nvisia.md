I work as a consultant on a wide-range of software, technologies, and cloud
  environments.

With a heavy focus on best practices and test-backed development, I leverage
these tools to help develop resillient and proven software for our clients.

To date I have had the pleasure to work with the lovely teams at:

* project44 | *Logtech startup*
* Federal Home Loan Bank Chicago | *Fintech*
