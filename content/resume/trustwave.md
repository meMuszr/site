Working at a company where cybersecurity was the heart of the product was a
very unique and humbling experience.

My most notable achievement was spearheading the development efforts to release
a new product offering in their Managed Security Services portfolio for
analysts to review periodic snapshots of threat activity. Additionally, I also:

- Collaborated with Product Management to identify, prioritize and document
  detailed product requirements
- Designed, developed and documented application and framework code in Java,
  Dart, and various query languages
- Worked with internal QE team on system, performance and acceptance testing
